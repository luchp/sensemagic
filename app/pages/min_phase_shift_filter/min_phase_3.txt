Documentation: Optimal Log-Magnitude Transitions for Minimum Group Delay 1. The Physical Relationship In minimum-phase systems, the group delay \(\tau _{g}\) is determined by the "smoothness" of the transition from the passband to the stopband in the log-magnitude response \(A(u)=\ln |H(\omega )|\). Fundamental Approximation As derived below, the group delay \(\tau _{g}\) is approximately proportional to the second derivative (curvature) of the log-magnitude response:\(\tau _{g}(\omega )\approx -\frac{\pi }{2\omega }\frac{d^{2}A}{du^{2}}\)where \(u=\ln \omega \). Therefore, to minimize the "energy" (variation) of the group delay, we must minimize the squared curvature of the log-magnitude transition. 2. Proof: Group Delay vs. Second Derivative We use Bode’s Phase-Magnitude Relation to prove the proportionality between \(\tau _{g}\) and \(A^{\prime \prime }(u)\). Step 1: Phase Integral The phase \(\phi (\omega _{0})\) is a weighted integral of the log-magnitude slope \(A^{\prime }(u)\):\(\phi (\omega _{0})=\frac{1}{\pi }\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }A^{\prime }(u)\cdot W(u-u_{0})\,du\)where \(W(u)=\ln \left(\coth \frac{|u|}{2}\right)\) is a symmetric, sharply peaked kernel. Step 2: Differentiating for Group Delay Since \(\tau _{g}=-\frac{d\phi }{d\omega }=-\frac{1}{\omega }\frac{d\phi }{du_{0}}\), we differentiate the integral:\(\frac{d\phi }{du_{0}}=\frac{1}{\pi }\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }A^{\prime \prime }(u)\cdot W(u-u_{0})\,du\)Step 3: Kernel Approximation Because \(W(u)\) is highly localized at \(u=0\), we treat \(A^{\prime \prime }(u)\) as locally constant (\(A^{\prime \prime }(u)\approx A^{\prime \prime }(u_{0})\)) and pull it out of the integral:\(\frac{d\phi }{du_{0}}\approx \frac{A^{\prime \prime }(u_{0})}{\pi }\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }W(u)\,du\)Evaluating the integral of the kernel: \(\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\ln \left(\coth \frac{|u|}{2}\right)du=\frac{\pi ^{2}}{2}\). Step 4: Final Proportionality \(\frac{d\phi }{du_{0}}\approx \frac{A^{\prime \prime }(u_{0})}{\pi }\cdot \frac{\pi ^{2}}{2}=\frac{\pi }{2}A^{\prime \prime }(u_{0})\)Substituting into the definition of \(\tau _{g}\):\(\tau _{g}(\omega )\approx -\frac{\pi }{2\omega }A^{\prime \prime }(u)\)3. Variational Minimization of Group Delay To find the optimal transition curve \(A(u)\), we minimize a cost functional \(J\) representing the "energy" of the group delay. The Cubic Trajectory (\(L^{2}\) Minimization) To minimize the integral of squared curvature:\(J=\int _{u_{1}}^{u_{2}}[A^{\prime \prime }(u)]^{2}\,du\)The Euler-Lagrange equation yields \(A^{(4)}(u)=0\). The solution is a Cubic Polynomial:\(A(u)=a_{3}u^{3}+a_{2}u^{2}+a_{1}u+a_{0}\)The Quintic Trajectory (\(L^{\prime \prime }\) Continuity) If we require the second derivative (and thus the group delay) to be continuous at the boundaries (\(A^{\prime \prime }(u_{1})=0,A^{\prime \prime }(u_{2})=0\)), we minimize the third derivative \(\int [A^{\prime \prime \prime }]^{2}du\). This yields \(A^{(6)}(u)=0\), leading to a Quintic Polynomial:\(A(u)=a_{5}u^{5}+a_{4}u^{4}+a_{3}u^{3}+a_{2}u^{2}+a_{1}u+a_{0}\)4.

Conclusion A Cubic transition is the minimum-energy solution for log-magnitude curvature. However, to ensure a physically realizable filter without group delay discontinuities at the corner frequencies, a Quintic or Raised Cosine transition is preferred as they satisfy the \(L^{\prime \prime }\) (second derivative) continuity requirement.
